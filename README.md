# Automate the Boring Stuff study group

Welcome to the "Automate the Boring Stuff" study group with the UCL Data and Insight Community of Practice. 

In this study group, we well be going through the famous book with the aim of improving our Python skills, incorporating more of it into our day to day work and enjoy making computers do things. 

Learning to code is difficult but it doesn't need to be lonely. Being surrounded by your peers is a helpful way to measure progress and rid yourself of imposter syndrome.

## Some rules and notes to keep in mind:

1. We're all learning. You're not stupid for not understanding something. 
2. Have fun. 
3. Be kind. Don't belittle, or needlessly criticise people for making mistakes or not understanding things straight away. 

### How to make the most of the study group

1. Come having read through the chapter for the week and attempted some of the problems 
2. If there's anything you're confused by, just bring it along. It's a great way to improve understanding!  
3. Try to join regularly. Progress comes through consistency! 
4. It helps to go through the chapter in your own time and come back with some of the coding problems that we can work through together.
