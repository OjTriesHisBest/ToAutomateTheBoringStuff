    "In this study group, we well be going through the famous book with the aim of improving our Python skills, incorporating more of it into our day to day work and enjoy making computers do things. \n",

    "1. Come having read through the chapter for the week and attempted some of the problems \n",

    "3. Try to join regularly. Progress comes through consistency! \n",
